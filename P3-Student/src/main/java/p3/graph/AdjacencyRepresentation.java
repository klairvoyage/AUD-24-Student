 * An interface for representing a directed graph using adjacency information for each node, i.e., storing for each node the
 * nodes it is connected/adjacent to, i.e., the nodes wo which it has an edge.
 * <p>
 * The nodes are represented with unique indices in the range {@code [0, size() - 1]}. The user of this interface is responsible for
 * maintaining the mapping between the indices and the nodes.
 * <p>
 * The representation is directed, i.e., an edge from node {@code A} to node {@code B} is different from an
 * edge from node {@code B} to node {@code A}. The existence of one of them does not imply the existence of the other.
 * <p>
 * The representation assumes a fixed number of nodes. The number of nodes can be increased by calling {@link #grow()},
 * however, this usually comes with a performance penalty.
